			<p class="BallinHeading">Welcome to Ballin'!</p>
			<br/>
			In this game there area several kinds of balls:
			<p class="tab">	- red balls: players balls </p>
			<p class="tab">	- grey balls: obstacles </p>
			<p class="tab">	- differently colored balls: target balls </p>
			<br/>
			The aim of the game: Try to hit the target balls with your players balls to push them into the colored gates. 
			The green balls have to be pushed into the blue gate, the blue balls into the blut gate... you get it!
			Before a target ball is allowed to enter its gate, it has to be activated. To activate a target ball, you have
			to hit it with your red players balls. An active target ball radiates particles. After a activated target ball
			has hit the boundaries 3 times, it will be deactivated again.
			
			<br/><br/>
			CONTROL:<br/>
			You can move your red players balls indirectly by moving the red magnet that slides on the outer circle. <br/>
			<p class="tab">	- Desktop: move the mouse around </p>
			<p class="tab">	- on mobile devices: hold your device (screen) parallel to the ground. Then rotate your device to move the magnet. Alternatively you can tab the screen to move the magnet. </p>
			<br/>
			After every level, a new ball will be added. The more balls - the crazier things get! Because I don't want to bother you to play your way through to the higher levels, you can jump to the desired level by setting the options in the upper right corner of the screen. You can also control the max speed of the balls and the number of particles that will be rendered (if your device struggles to support a high frame rate, you can reduce the number of particles generated to speed things up)

			<p class="BallinHeading">Happy Ballin'!</p>
